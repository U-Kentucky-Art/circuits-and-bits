#Repetition/Pattern/Ornamentation

###Assignment1: Geometric Shape Ornament
Using geometric shapes, lines and curves only, create a sample ornament. Refer to https://github.com/U-Kentucky-Art/circuits-and-bits/tree/master/004_functions but try to make something cooler (i.e. more visually engaging.) Size: at least 5 rows and 5 columns of repeating ornamental motif

###Assignment2: Pixel-based Ornament
Same as above but using actual pixel (or raster) images. Try to break away from the straight grid by using rotation and clustering of images. Ornamental motif can be created/edited in Photoshop.

Drawing upon the work you saw during artist presentations, you will create an artwork, using Processing together with another artistic medium of your choice). Aesthetic dimensions of repetition, ornament and pattern formation should be explored. This assignment will be initiated with a quick one paragraph proposal followed by both in-class and independent production time.
